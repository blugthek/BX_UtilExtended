## Lua Module with Metaprogramming Techniques

This repository provides a Lua module that demonstrates techniques for creating custom functions and function callers using metaprogramming. It's designed to be helpful for developers working with Lua who want to:

* **Create custom modules:** Organize your code into reusable modules with functions and variables.
* **Leverage metaprogramming:** Extend Lua's functionality by dynamically modifying tables and creating custom behaviors.

**Dependencies:**

* [`ox_lib`](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) (or similar library)
